# FreeCell
Text-based FreeCell Solitaire game

FreeCell is a solitaire card game played using the standard 52-card deck. 
It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few deals are unsolvable, 
and all cards are dealt face-up from the very beginning of the game.

Focused on OOD principles.
